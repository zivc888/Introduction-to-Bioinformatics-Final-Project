# Genetic Identification of Bipolar Disorder
### Introduction to Bioinformatics - Final Project
Bipolar disorder is a psychiatric illness which is characterized by extreme mood swings 
between euphoria (mania) and depression. It is mainly genetic although the biological 
mechanisms which are underlying it are mostly unknown. Therefore, it is yet unknown how 
to identify patients with bipolar disorder based on biological measures but rather only 
based on behavioral patterns which can be detected only after an outbreak of the disorder – 
too late to prevent or prepare for the condition. In this study, we aimed to identify how 
people who suffer from bipolar disorder differ from healthy people and schizophrenic 
people on the microenvironmental level – gene expression levels and enriched pathways – 
in order to better understand and diagnose bipolar disorder and treat accordingly. We 
performed differential gene expression and GSEA to identify potential genes and pathways 
that could act as biomarkers for bipolar disorder, we then used xCell, to try and find what 
changes in the cellular composition happen in the presence of bipolar disorder and lastly, 
we tried to classify the bipolar disorder samples using unsupervised clustering based on 
biological measures. We have identified the genes MTND6P4, LINC02340 and MT1X as 
candidates to be biomarkers of bipolar disorder. In the 46th area we have identified the 
genes MTND6P4 and MT1X again as well as the gene CHI3L2 to be candidates as areal 
biomarkers. Moreover, we found many pathways which are associated with bipolar 
disorder, the most significant of them were those responsible for interferon alpha response, 
interferon gamma response and hypoxia. Unfortunately, we failed both to spot a difference 
in the cellular composition between bipolar disorder and healthy patients and to divide the 
bipolar patients into subtypes. In conclusion, we gathered enough evidence to support our 
claim that bipolar disorder can be discovered based on biological methods but nonetheless, 
there is still much research that must be made in order to come to better and more 
beneficial findings.
